	\subsection*{Symmetric Ciphers}
	Symmetric Ciphers are divided into \textbf{Stream Ciphers} and \textbf{Block Ciphers}.
	
	\textit{Block Ciphers} encrypt entire blocks of bits at a time with the same key, such as AES-128. Block Ciphers are used more often on the Internet.
	
	\textit{Stream Ciphers} encrypts bits individually. This is done by adding (the same as XOR) a bit from the \textit{key stream} to a plaintext bit (modulus 2). 
	

	\subsection*{The One-Time Pad}
	\textit{The One-Time Pad (OPD)} is a perfect cipher. Meaning, unconditional security cipher: it cannot be broken even with infinite computational resources.
	
	\subsubsection*{Defintion: OTP}
	\textit{A stream cipher for which}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the key stream $s_0,s_1,s_2,...$ is generated by a \textit{true} random number generator (TNRG)
		\item the key stream is only known to the legitimate communicating parties
		\item every key stream bit $s_i$ is used only once
	\end{enumerate} 
	
	The need for a TNRG means that the device has to have the capability to produce truly random bits, such as from a dice roll or white noise. 
	
	To ensure that the key stream isn't leaked, we must have a perfectly secure channel of communication.
	
	The fact that each key bit is only used ones means that there is an equal amount of plaintext as keys bits
	
	\subsubsection*{Improving substitution ciphers}
	Substitution ciphers can be solved using frequency analysis, so we need to improve the cipher.
	
	This can be done by inserting additional symbols into the ciphertext with no meaning. Use a different alphabet to represent the ciphertext. Combining transposition with substitution. 
	
	\subsection*{The Vigenère cipher}
	A different \textit{Ceasar Shift} is applied to each letter of the plaintext.
	
	The key to this cipher is a sequence of numbers, explaining the shift length. If the plaintext is longer than the sequence, it repeats. 
	
	Example: The letters "enemy" $\rightarrow$ "JBBQQ" encrypted using the sequence (5,14,23,4,18). 
	
	The trick to remembering the sequence, is to shift the letter "a" to these numbers, for example: "aaaaa"  "FOXES"	
	
	\subsubsection*{Breaking the Vigenère cipher}
	If we know the sequence length, we can split the ciphertext into multiple strings of the sequence length, and individually crack them.  
	\\\\
	Suppose we have the plaintext encoded by numbers: $x_0,x_1,x_2,...$. And the key $k_0,k_1,k_2,...,k_{n-1}$ of length $n$  
	
	Using the formula we can get the ciphertext $y_i$:
	$$
	y_i = (x_i + k_{i MOD n}) MOD 26
	$$
	
	For example:
	Assume we have the key: "fishy", which corresponds to the sequence (5,8,18,7,24). 
	
	If we want to decrypt the cipher text "KQJZR", which in numeric corresponds to the "10,16,9,25,17", we would apply the formula 5 times:
	\[
	\begin{split}
		10 	&= (x_0 + 5_{0 MOD 5}) MOD 26 \\
		10	&= (x_0 + 5_0) MOD 26 \\
		5	&= x_0 MOD 26 \\
		x_0 &= 5
	\end{split}
	\]
	So the first letter "K" $\rightarrow$ "f". Continuing this process, "KQJZR" $\rightarrow$ "first".
	
	\subsection*{Kasiski method for guessing the key length in a Vigenère cipher}
	Using the \textit{Kasiski method} we can guess the key length $n$, by finding the greatest common divisor of the most common digrams and trigrams.
	
	After we have guessed the key length $n$, we can divide the cipher text into $n$ substrings. We can find the key letter by doing a frequency analysis on each column (representing each key letter). 
	
	\subsection*{Friedman's method for computing the key length in a Vigenère Cipher}
	We need to compute the \textit{Index of Coincidence} (IOC) $I$, before we can calculate the key length. 
	
	\subsubsection*{Computing the IOC for a ciphertext}
	Let $n_0,n_1,n_2,...,n_25$ be the number of As,Bs,Cs,...,Zs in the ciphertext. And $n$ be the total length of the ciphertext.
		
	We can calculate the IOC $I$ by obtaining the number of identical letters.
	
	$$
	I = \frac{\sum_{0}^{25}n_i(n_i-1)}{n(n-1)}
	$$
	
	\subsubsection*{Using the IOC to estimate the key length of a Vigenère cipher}
	With a ciphertext of length $n$, the key length $k$, can be approximated using this formula:
	$$
	k \approx \frac{0.0265n}{(0.065-I) + n(I-0.0385)} 
	$$
	Where $I$ is the IOC calculated above.
	\\\\
	$0.065$ is the probability of choosing 2 identical letters in a English plaintext. $0.0385$ is the probability of choosing 2 identical letters randomly selected. And $0.0265 = 0.65 - 0.0385$
	
	\subsection*{The Chinese Remainder}
	\textbf{Theorem}. Given pairwise coprime positive integers $n_1,n_2,...,n_k$ and arbitrary integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_k$, the system of simultaneous congruences
	\[
	\begin{split}
	x &\equiv a_1 (mod \ n_1) \\
	x &\equiv a_1 (mod \ n_1) \\
	\ . &\\
	\ . &\\
	\ . &\\
	\ x &\equiv a_1 (mod \ n_1)
	\end{split}
	\]
	has a unique solution modulo $N = n_1,n_2,...,n_k$.
	\\\\
	Example:
	\[
	\begin{split}
	x &\equiv 6 (mod \ 7) \\
	x &\equiv 4 (mod \ 8) 
	\end{split}
	\]
	We begin by calculating $N$, and new $n_1,n_2$
	\[
	\begin{split}
	N & = 7*8 = 56 \\
	n_1 &=N/7 = 8 \\
	n_1 &=N/8 = 7 
	\end{split}
	\]
	So $x$ becomes:
	$$
	x=6*8+4*7 = 76 
	$$
	$$
	x=[76]_{56}=[20]_{56}
	$$
	$$
	x \equiv 20 (mod \ 56)
	$$
	
	\subsection*{Summary of Complexity Theory}
	Complexity Theory is the study of \textit{time complexity}, how long it will take to compute functions, and the cost of computation.
	
	We use the \textbf{Big-O notation}, O(n), to measure the time complexity of functions and algorithms. 
	\\\\
	Example: Let $f : R \rightarrow R$ be given by $f(x) = 10x +30$.
	Then $f$ is $O(x)$, on $x\geq 1$:
	$$
	|f(x)| = |10x +30| \leq |10x +30x| = |40x| = 40|x|
	$$
	because the constant 40 is insignificantly small on large x.
	
	\subsubsection*{Complexity classes}
	\textit{Complexity class P}, is polynomial-time solvable. Which means a Turing machine could solve it.
	\\\\
	\textit{Complexity class ExpTime}, is exponential-time solvable, again with a Turing machine.
	\\\\
	\textit{Complexity class NP}, is non-deterministic polynomial-time solvable.
